            Each round, one player is the <strong>Interviewer</strong> and will
            pick a job card at random, while every other player is an
            <strong>Interviewee</strong> and will receive 5 phrase cards. They
            must interview for the position with the Interviewer and their pitch
            must contain every phrase on each of their cards.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph m-3">
            After all players have interviewed, the Interviewer decides who gets
            the job, receives the job card, and wins the round. The game is won
            after a player wins a predetermined number of job cards.
